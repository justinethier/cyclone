# SRFI 111 - Boxes

The `(srfi 111)` library defines boxes, a container for an object of any Scheme type, including another box. Boxes are normally used as minimal mutable storage, and can inject a controlled amount of mutability into an otherwise immutable data structure (or one that is conventionally treated as immutable). 

See the [SRFI document](http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/srfi-111.html) for more information.
